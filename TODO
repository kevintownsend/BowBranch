Keep this TODO file short. Submit requests to:
https://github.com/testsubject42/BowBranch/issues.
1. Create a style guide. Port style to follow:
http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/standards.html if this does not specify
a style than use
http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml or your
own common sense.
2. Following from above, fix the mixing of space and tab indents and use 2
space indents (Sorry, it's a pet peeve of mine).
